# ConnectFour---AI-Algorithm-Minimax-
This is my ConnectFour game version where you can play against a friend or even the computer. The computer uses the Minimax AI algorithm(I never beat him)

The game starts with a menu where you can choose if you want to play against a friend or the computer.

Then, you can start yo play and try to beat the computer. I assure you it's pretty hard :))
